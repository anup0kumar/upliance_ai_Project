# Upliance Assignment 

## Overview  
This project analyzes customer order data and visualizes key insights using Power BI. A new column, `Age_Category`, was introduced in the dataset to group users into three age groups:  
- **< 25 years**  
- **25–35 years**  
- **> 35 years**  

The dashboard highlights trends in customer preferences, order distribution, and revenue across age categories, locations, and dishes.  

## Key Features  
1. **Age-Based Analysis:**  
   - Orders and revenue are segmented by `Age_Category`.  
   - Insights into the dominant age groups contributing to sales.  

2. **Location-Based Insights:**  
   - Total orders and revenue visualized by location.  
   - Top-performing cities like New York and Chicago.  

3. **Dish Preferences:**  
   - Popular dishes ranked by revenue (e.g., Spaghetti, Grilled Chicken).  

4. **Time of Day Analysis:**  
   - Orders distributed evenly across Morning, Day, and Night.  

5. **Customer Analysis:**  
   - Top 5 customers by total orders.  

6. **Meal Preferences:**  
   - 44.72% of the Revenue generated is from dinner meal then comes the Lunch.
